        "\n",
        "**Purpose:** To dynamically select the most appropriate, clinically-informed therapeutic strategy based on the multi-faceted output of the `EmotionalIntelligenceEngine`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Design Rationale:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A simple, rule-based engine was deliberately chosen for this critical task due to its **safety, predictability, and interpretability**. Different emotional states require different therapeutic approaches, and this engine enforces that logic reliably.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Prioritized Triage Logic:** The core of the engine is a decision tree (`if/elif/else` structure) that mimics clinical triage. It first checks for the most urgent condition—a high `crisis_level`. This ensures that safety and stabilization are **always** the absolute top priority, overriding all other emotional indicators. This deterministic approach is crucial for safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **From Analysis to Action:** This engine acts as the bridge between analysis and generation. It consumes the rich, structured data from the `EmotionalIntelligenceEngine` (emotions, distortions) and translates it into a single, actionable strategy. This ensures the AI's response is not just a random string of text but a purposeful intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Modular and Extensible Strategy Library:** All therapeutic approaches are defined in a simple dictionary (`self.therapy_approaches`). This design is highly modular:\n",
        "    *   It **decouples the decision logic** (the `select_strategy` method) **from the strategy definitions**.\n",
        "    *   This makes it incredibly easy to add new therapeutic strategies (e.g., `'mindfulness_focused'`) in the future without rewriting the core decision-making code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Safe Fallback Mechanism:** The engine includes a default return value (`'cognitive_restructuring'`). This ensures that even if the user's input is ambiguous and doesn't trigger any other rule, the system can always select a safe, generally helpful, and core CBT strategy.\n"

        "\n",
        "**Purpose:** To enhance the Large Language Model's responses by grounding them in a reliable, external knowledge base. This mitigates model hallucinations, provides up-to-date information, and allows for specialized domain knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Design Rationale:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Choice of Vector Database (`ChromaDB`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** `ChromaDB` was selected as the vector store for its simplicity and efficiency in a development environment. The `PersistentClient` allows the database to be saved to disk, meaning the knowledge base is preserved between sessions without requiring a dedicated server. This makes the entire application self-contained and portable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Choice of Embedding Model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** This `SentenceTransformer` model represents an excellent balance of performance and size. It is highly effective at capturing the semantic meaning of text and converting it into dense vectors for similarity search. Its small footprint ensures that the embedding process is fast and does not require significant computational resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Robust Initialization and Connection:**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** The `__init__` method is designed to be resilient. The `get_or_create_collection` command ensures that the engine can seamlessly connect to an existing knowledge base or initialize a new one if it doesn't exist. The additional `try...except` block provides a fallback mechanism, making the startup process more robust by attempting to connect to any available collection if the primary one is empty.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Decoupled Retrieval Logic:**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** The `retrieve_relevant_knowledge` method encapsulates the core retrieval logic. It takes a simple text query and returns a clean, structured list of dictionaries. This clean interface decouples the complexities of vector search from the main generation engine, which simply needs to request and receive knowledge snippets. The error handling ensures that if the query fails for any reason, it returns an empty list instead of crashing the application.\n"

        "**Design Rationale:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This class is the cornerstone of the model's performance. It moves beyond simple imitation and implements a form of **\"process-supervised\" learning**, where the model is taught the steps to arrive at a good answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Instruction Fine-Tuning Format (`<SYS>` and `[INST]`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** The `create_ultimate_prompt` method is the core innovation. It uses a formal instruction-following format (popularized by models like Llama and Mistral). By placing the entire clinical assessment and persona instructions inside a **System Prompt (`<<SYS>>...<</SYS>>`)**, we create a clear separation between the model's \"internal thoughts\" and the user's turn. This prevents the model from getting confused and outputting its own instructions during a real conversation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Simulating Chain-of-Thought (CoT):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** The system prompt doesn't just tell the model to be a therapist; it provides the *exact analysis* for that specific example (emotions, distortions, strategy). This is a powerful technique. We are showing the model the **chain of thought** that a human therapist would follow: `Analysis -> Strategy -> Tone -> Response`. By training on thousands of these examples, the model learns to implicitly generate this chain of thought for new, unseen inputs at inference time.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **High-Quality Seed Data (`master_examples`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** The quality of a fine-tuned model is capped by the quality of its best training examples. These hand-crafted `master_examples` act as powerful anchors, demonstrating the ideal tone, empathy, and structure. They ensure the model has a strong foundation of \"what great looks like.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Heuristic-Driven Data Augmentation:**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** The logic to create an `alt_prompt` by swapping the primary emotion focus is a simple but effective data augmentation technique. It teaches the model that complex emotional states can be approached from multiple angles, improving its flexibility and generalization for users expressing multiple concerns.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Output Standardization (`enhance_output_quality`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** This method ensures that all target responses in the dataset are structurally sound and adhere to best practices (e.g., ending with a collaborative question). This consistency in the target data leads to more reliable and predictable behavior from the trained model.\n"

        "\n",
        "**Design Rationale:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A standard `EarlyStoppingCallback` is good, but it only looks at one metric (like evaluation loss). This custom callback introduces a more intelligent, multi-faceted approach to supervising the training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Heuristic-Based Quality Metric (`calculate_response_quality`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** Quantitative metrics like \"loss\" don't capture the full picture of what makes a therapeutic response *good*. This function attempts to create a **qualitative, proxy metric**. It operationalizes clinical best practices by checking for the presence of language related to validation, collaboration, hope, and cognitive exploration. While not used for stopping in this version of the `on_log` function, it's a powerful tool for evaluating generated text during or after training.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Advanced Early Stopping Logic (`on_log`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** This is the core of the callback. It implements a **dual-criterion stopping mechanism** to find the \"sweet spot\" of training.\n",
        "        *   **Patience-Based Stopping:** This is a classic technique to prevent wasting compute resources. If the model's training loss stops improving for a set number of steps (`patience`), it indicates a learning plateau, and the callback wisely halts the process.\n",
        "        *   **Absolute Performance Threshold:** The `if current_loss <= 0.3:` check is a crucial optimization. In fine-tuning, reaching an extremely low loss can be a sign that the model is beginning to overfit and simply memorize the training data. By setting an absolute \"good enough\" threshold, we can stop the training when the model has clearly mastered the dataset's patterns, preserving its ability to generalize to new, unseen inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Comprehensive Logging and Reporting (`on_train_end`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** Good MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) requires good record-keeping. The `on_train_end` hook provides a clean, final summary of the most important metrics from the training run. This makes it much easier to compare different experiments and track the model's progress without having to manually parse through long log files.\n"

        "\n",
        "**Purpose:** To define the precise methodology for adapting the pre-trained model to our CBT therapy dataset, balancing performance, speed, and memory efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Design Rationale:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This configuration implements the **QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)** technique, a highly efficient method for fine-tuning large models.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **LoRA Configuration (`LoraConfig`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** Instead of retraining all 2.7 billion parameters of the model (which is computationally expensive), we freeze the original model and inject small, trainable \"adapter\" layers. This drastically reduces the number of parameters we need to update, saving memory and time.\n",
        "    *   `r=32` & `lora_alpha=64`: These are crucial hyperparameters. `r` (rank) determines the size of the adapter matrices. A higher rank (like 32) gives the model more capacity to learn complex new information. `lora_alpha` is a scaling factor that magnifies the impact of these adapters. A common and effective practice is to set `alpha` to twice the `r`, which we follow here for strong adaptation.\n",
        "    *   `target_modules=[...]`: This is a critical optimization. We are specifically telling LoRA to attach adapters to the most important layers of the transformer architecture—the query, key, and value projection matrices (`q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj`) and the feed-forward network layers (`dense`, `fc1`, `fc2`). This focuses the training on the parts of the model that contribute most to understanding and generating language.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Training Arguments (`TrainingArguments`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** These arguments are meticulously tuned to create a stable and effective training loop.\n",
        "    *   **Memory Management:** The combination of `per_device_train_batch_size=2` and `gradient_accumulation_steps=4` is a key technique for training with limited VRAM. The model processes only 2 examples at a time, but it accumulates the gradients over 4 steps before performing a weight update. This achieves the learning stability of a larger **effective batch size of 8** (`2 * 4`) while only requiring the memory for a batch size of 2.\n",
        "    *   **Learning Schedule:** We use a `learning_rate` of `2e-5`, a well-established default for the AdamW optimizer that balances learning speed with stability. The `warmup_ratio=0.05` prevents the model from making drastic, damaging updates at the very start of training by gradually increasing the learning rate.\n",
        "    *   **Robust Evaluation and Saving:** By setting `eval_strategy=\"steps\"` and `load_best_model_at_end=True`, we create a robust training process. The trainer will evaluate the model's performance on the validation set every 25 steps. It keeps track of the checkpoint with the lowest `eval_loss` and automatically loads that one as the final, best model. This ensures we don't accidentally save a worse model from a later, overfitted epoch.\n",
        "    *   `fp16=True`: Enables mixed-precision training, which uses 16-bit floating-point numbers for certain operations. This significantly speeds up training and further reduces memory consumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **The Ultimate Trainer (`SFTTrainer`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** We use the `SFTTrainer` from the TRL library, which is specifically designed for supervised fine-tuning of language"

The `SFTTrainer` handles everything defined in the `TrainingArguments`: batching the data, performing forward and backward passes, calculating gradients, updating the LoRA weights with the AdamW optimizer, running periodic evaluations, and managing checkpoints. Because we set `load_best_model_at_end=True`, the `trainer.model` object at the end of this call is guaranteed to be the version that achieved the lowest loss on the evaluation set, protecting us from overfitting.\n",

        "    *   **Saving PEFT Adapters (`trainer.model.save_pretrained`):** This is a key advantage of the LoRA method. We are **not** saving another 2.7 billion parameter model. Instead, we are saving only the small adapter layers that were trained. The resulting files are typically only a few dozen megabytes in size, making the model incredibly portable and fast to load. The base `phi-2` model remains untouched.\n",
        "    *   **Saving the Tokenizer (`tokenizer.save_pretrained`):** It is critical to save the exact tokenizer configuration used during training alongside the model. This guarantees that text is processed identically during inference as it was during training, preventing subtle bugs and performance degradation.\n",
        "    *   **Model Versioning with Metadata:** Creating a `model_metadata.json` file is a core MLOps best practice. A model without context is difficult to manage. This file acts as a permanent record, answering key questions for future developers (or ourselves): When was this made? What data was it trained on? What was it designed to do? This is essential for reproducibility, tracking experiments, and ensuring models are used correctly in production.\n"

        "# 14 Ensuring a Reproducible and Conflict-Free Python Environment\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose:** To create a stable, predictable, and clean environment for the training process, eliminating common sources of errors related to library version conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Design Rationale:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Cloud environments like Google Colab come with many pre-installed Python libraries. While convenient, this can lead to a problem known as **\"dependency hell,\"** where the pre-installed versions conflict with the specific versions required by our advanced fine-tuning scripts. This code block implements a robust, three-step solution:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Forceful Uninstallation (The \"Nuke\"):** The first command (`pip uninstall ... -y`) acts as a \"hard reset.\" It removes any existing installations of the critical libraries from the environment. This is a defensive measure that guarantees we are starting from a known, clean state, rather than hoping the existing libraries are compatible.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Atomic Installation (The \"Pave\"):** We install all required dependencies in a single `pip install` command. This is significantly better than installing them one by one. When run together, `pip`'s dependency resolver can analyze all the requirements at once and find a set of package versions that are mutually compatible. This drastically reduces the chance of version mismatch errors. We also add `vaderSentiment`, `sentence-transformers`, and `chromadb` to support our advanced `EmotionalIntelligenceEngine` and `RAGKnowledgeEngine`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Mandatory Runtime Restart:** This is the most critical step for the user. When libraries are installed in a running Jupyter/Colab session, the Python kernel often keeps the old versions loaded in memory. Simply running the install command is not enough to make the notebook use the new versions. A **runtime restart** is required to completely reload the environment and force the kernel to load the fresh libraries from the disk. Skipping this step is the most common reason for notebook failures.\n"

        "    *   **Reasoning:** This is the core of our AI. `torch` provides the fundamental deep learning framework. `transformers` from Hugging Face is the industry standard for accessing pre-trained models like `phi-2`. `peft` (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) is critically important, as it allows us to load our small, efficient adapter weights on top of the base model.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Stack (`chromadb`, `embedding_functions`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** To give the model external knowledge, we need a RAG system. `chromadb` was chosen as it is a lightweight, open-source vector database that runs directly in the notebook, making it perfect for development and demos. The `embedding_functions` will be used to convert user queries and knowledge snippets into numerical vectors for similarity searching.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **The Natural Language Processing (NLP) Toolkit (`vaderSentiment`, `re`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** Beyond the LLM, we need specific NLP tools. `vaderSentiment` is a fast, rule-based sentiment analyzer that gives us a quick emotional reading without needing a separate AI model. The `re` (regular expressions) module is essential for the text cleaning and post-processing steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **The Application & UI Framework (`gradio`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** To make the model interactive, `gradio` was selected. It is a high-level library that makes it incredibly easy to build a user-friendly web interface for any machine learning model directly within a Python script, which is ideal for creating demos.\n",

        "5.  **Core Python Utilities (`deque`, `random`, `os`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** These are standard libraries for fundamental tasks. `deque` provides an efficient way to manage the conversation memory, `random` helps in adding variety to responses, and `os` is used for interacting with the file system.\n"

        "**Purpose:** To provide a fast, reliable, and interpretable analysis of the user's emotional and cognitive state. This analysis serves as the primary input for the `CBTResponseStrategyEngine` to select an appropriate therapeutic approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Design Rationale:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A rule-based, heuristic engine was deliberately chosen over a complex machine learning model for this task due to several key advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Speed and Efficiency:** The engine uses keyword matching and the lightweight `VaderSentiment` library. This analysis is nearly instantaneous and has a negligible computational cost, ensuring the application remains responsive.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Interpretability and Control:** The logic is completely transparent. If the engine detects 'anxiety', it's because a specific keyword from our predefined list was present. This makes the system easy to debug, test, and refine. We have full control over what it looks for.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Clinically-Informed Dictionaries:** The keyword lists for `emotion_patterns` and `cognitive_distortions` are not arbitrary.

        "# 18. The Central Orchestration Pipeline for Inference\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose:** To serve as the central, stateful engine that orchestrates all AI components (Analysis, RAG, Memory, and LLM) to manage a coherent, context-aware, and therapeutically-grounded conversation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Design Rationale:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This class is the heart of the application at runtime, and its design reflects a sophisticated, multi-stage approach to response generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Modular Orchestration:** The engine doesn't do everything itself. Instead, it acts as a \"conductor,\" calling upon specialized modules for their specific tasks (`EI` for analysis, `RAG` for knowledge). This makes the entire system cleaner, easier to debug, and allows individual components to be upgraded without breaking the whole application.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Multi-Context Prompt Engineering:** This is the engine's most critical function. The quality of the LLM's output is directly proportional to the quality of its prompt. This engine constructs a rich prompt by combining three distinct sources of context:\n",
        "    *   **Knowledge Context (RAG):** Provides factual, grounding information to ensure the response is accurate and detailed.\n",
        "    *   **Temporal Context (Memory):** Provides the recent conversation history, allowing the model to produce responses that are natural, relevant, and refer back to previous points.\n",
        "    *   **Immediate Context (User Input):** The user's most recent message.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **The Generation-Polishing Pipeline:** The process is deliberately split into two phases:\n",
        "    *   **Generation:** The `model.generate()` call, with carefully tuned parameters (`temperature`, `top_p`, `repetition_penalty`), produces the raw creative output from the LLM.\n",
        "    *   **Polishing (`post_process_response`):** This is a crucial \"quality control\" step. Raw LLM output can be messy—it can contain stop tokens, have awkward capitalization, or ramble. This function acts as a deterministic filter that cleans up artifacts, enforces proper sentence structure, and ensures the response ends with a collaborative, user-engaging question.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Stateful Conversation Management:** The `conversation_memory` (a `deque`) is what transforms the chatbot from a simple question-answer machine into a conversational partner. By storing the last few turns, it gives the AI a \"short-term memory,\" which is essential for building rapport and having a meaningful dialogue. The `deque` is highly efficient for this task, automatically discarding the oldest turns as new ones are added.\n"

        "\n",
        "**Purpose:** To efficiently load the fine-tuned model into memory for real-time use. This process involves composing the original base model with our trained adapter weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Design Rationale:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The key advantage of PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) with LoRA is that we don't save a massive, multi-billion parameter model. Instead, we only save the small, trained \"adapters.\" This loading script demonstrates the standard procedure for reconstructing the full model in memory for inference:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Load the Quantized Base Model:**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** The original `phi-2` model is still the foundation. We must load it first. To make it fit within the limited VRAM of a Colab GPU, we use the same `BitsAndBytesConfig` as in training. This loads the model's weights in a highly compressed 4-bit format (`nf4`), drastically reducing its memory footprint. `device_map=\"auto\"` ensures it's placed on the GPU correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Load the Consistent Tokenizer:**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** It is a critical best practice to load the tokenizer from the **adapter's save directory (`ADAPTER_PATH`)**, not from the original model hub. This guarantees that we use the exact same tokenizer configuration (including any special tokens or settings) that was used during fine-tuning, preventing subtle errors during inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Apply the PEFT Adapters:**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** This is the most important step. The `PeftModel.from_pretrained()` command takes the large, frozen, and quantized `base_model` and dynamically applies our small, trained adapter weights to it. This fusion happens in memory and creates the final, specialized model that has learned all the nuances from our CBT dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "This entire process is highly efficient. It allows us to leverage the power of a large foundation model while only needing to store and load a few megabytes of adapter data, making our custom AI highly portable.\n"

        "    *   **Reasoning:** Gradio was chosen because it is the industry standard for rapidly creating machine learning demos. It abstracts away all the complex boilerplate of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, backend APIs), allowing us to build a fully functional UI with just a few lines of Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **The Controller Function (`chat_function`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** This function acts as a simple \"bridge\" or \"adapter\" between the Gradio frontend and our complex backend engine. Gradio's `ChatInterface` expects a simple function that takes `message` and `history` as input. Our `chat_function` cleanly wraps the call to `generation_engine.generate_master_response`, hiding all the internal complexity (RAG, memory, analysis, etc.) from the UI layer. This is a robust software design pattern.\n",

        "    *   **Reasoning:** The parameters within `gr.ChatInterface` are not just for function but also for user experience.\n",
        "        *   `title`, `description`: These clearly set the user's expectations about what the model is and its capabilities.\n",
        "        *   `examples`: These serve as an onboarding tool, guiding the user on how to interact with the model effectively and showcasing its strengths.\n",
        "        *   `chatbot=gr.Chatbot(height=400)`: Fine-tuning the component's height prevents the UI from becoming too long or too short, improving usability.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Accessible and Shareable Deployment (`iface.launch`):**\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning:** The `share=True` parameter is a key feature. It automatically creates a temporary, public URL for the application through a Gradio tunnel. This makes the project instantly shareable with colleagues or stakeholders for feedback or demonstration, without needing to manually deploy it to a server.\n"
